<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>The first paragraph hooked me.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Deep in your innermost being, you’ve always known you were destined to learn Clojure. Every time you held your keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible class hierarchy; every time you lay awake at night, disturbing your loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every time a race condition caused you to pull out more of your ever-dwindling hair, some secret part of you has known that there has to be a better way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow.
I did not know I felt this way, but after reading this I can not get over that feeling.</p>
<h3 id="the-forest-of-tooling">The Forest of Tooling</h3>
<p>I need to make an effort to not get suck here.
I have a habit of playing with tooling and turning all the dials.
Much of that tweaking will probably be better after I have some idea of pain points.</p>
<h3 id="the-mountain-of-language">The Mountain of Language</h3>
<p>Looking forward to my first expose to any Lisp.
Long live the parentheses!</p>
<h3 id="the-cave-of-artifacts">The Cave of Artifacts</h3>
<p>I wonder if my brief experience with Java and the JVM will be any help here.</p>
<h3 id="the-cloud-castle-of-mindset">The Cloud Castle of Mindset</h3>
<p>Really looking forward to this section.
Being able to apply Clojure correctly to the problems I am trying to solve.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Clojure now ships with a <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">native cli, <code>clj</code></a>.
Question: How does this compare to the book’s (and most other tutorials) recommendation of <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>?</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>I am having a hard time deciding if I should just bite the bullet and learn vanilla emacs.
I’ve used (neo)vim for so long that I do not even have to think about what I want to do.
That muscle memory is hard to defeat.
I tried <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">spacemacs</a> and felt it was a bit much, although I did really like the leader mnemonics.
Next I tried just <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">evil</a> which is nice, and where I am now.
I feel like not using emacs bindings as first class may cause more pain down the line.</p>
