## Foreword

The first paragraph hooked me.

## Introduction

> Deep in your innermost being, youâ€™ve always known you were destined to learn Clojure. Every time you held your keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible class hierarchy; every time you lay awake at night, disturbing your loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every time a race condition caused you to pull out more of your ever-dwindling hair, some secret part of you has known that there has to be a better way.

Wow.
I did not know I felt this way, but after reading this I can not get over that feeling.


### The Forest of Tooling

I need to make an effort to not get suck here.
I have a habit of playing with tooling and turning all the dials.
Much of that tweaking will probably be better after I have some idea of pain points.

### The Mountain of Language

Looking forward to my first expose to any Lisp.
Long live the parentheses!

### The Cave of Artifacts

I wonder if my brief experience with Java and the JVM will be any help here.

### The Cloud Castle of Mindset

Really looking forward to this section.
Being able to apply Clojure correctly to the problems I am trying to solve.

## Chapter 1

Clojure now ships with a [native cli, `clj`](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli).
Question: How does this compare to the book's (and most other tutorials) recommendation of [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)?


## Chapter 2

I am having a hard time deciding if I should just bite the bullet and learn vanilla emacs.
I've used (neo)vim for so long that I do not even have to think about what I want to do.
That muscle memory is hard to defeat.
I tried [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) and felt it was a bit much, although I did really like the leader mnemonics.
Next I tried just [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) which is nice, and where I am now.
I feel like not using emacs bindings as first class may cause more pain down the line.
