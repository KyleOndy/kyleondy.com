This is a list of books I have queued up for reading.
Once I've begun a book I'll add a link to the page where I make my notes as I go along.

This list is bucketed into roughs categories, then sorted lexicography within each bucket.
Any other ordering seemed unfair.

Books in **bold** are high on my priority list to read.

<!-- todo: add tag support to the blog -->
You can find all my current notes on [the 'books' tag](#/tags/books).
