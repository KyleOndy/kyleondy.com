Here are the things I'd like to get done on this site.

## Content

- add CV / resume
- keybase stuff
- seo (google / ddg) results
- structured data (google snipits)
- README

## Styling and Structure

- hakyll-sass -> comment on PR -> fork -> upload to hackage / stackage -> PR to include in lts
- tags
- images are not responsive (CirclCI)
- aside and source blocks don't quite lineup
- code font - make sure everyone has it? looks different on some devices

## Infra

- logging?
- feed.xml vs atom.xml

## New Features / Ideas

- [code graph](https://github.com/meoblast001/meosite/tree/master/code-graph). (could add to opensource page)
- qutebrowser -> :config-write-py -> add to dots

## General

- start writing ~2 posts a month
