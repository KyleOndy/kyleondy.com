This is the personal website of Kyle Ondy, a technology professional living in New Jersey.
Professionally I enjoy working with automation, CI/CD pipelines, and back-end development.
In my personal time I spend my time learning about functional programming, it's associated paradigms, and math, so I mainly write about those.
