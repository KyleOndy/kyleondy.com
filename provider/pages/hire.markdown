I am looking for a positive company culture as much, if not more than the need
for a challenging problem domain. I like to solve difficult and unconventional
  problems working along with a motivated small team.

The following is a rundown on my ideal role; _if I won the job lottery_. I
acknowledge this is a unicorn, but this is an accurate description of the type
of role I would like to be in long-term.


## About Me

I find great satisfaction increasing productivity via automation, both for
saving resources, and for documentation via automation. I have fallen hard for
functional programming am try to apply the concepts and paradigms to everything
I do.

Working with short iteration and feedback cycles is integral to my
productivity. Due to my work style, I make extensive use of testing, scripting,
and automation to allow me to close the feedback loop while solving problems.


## Where

**100% Remote.**
I would enjoy an occasional visit to a NYC or Philadelphia office location.


## What I am Looking For

### Company

The company should fall into one of the three following categories.

1) A clear and obvious net good to society, simply, I should be proud to work there.
2) Aligns with my personal interests
    * Supporting people in outdoor recreations
    * The maker movement
    * Has heavy contributions to opensource
3) Compensates well enough to make me care a bit less about the prior two
   points.

If the company is in ad-tech, defense-tech, or crypto-currency, its going to be
a really hard sell, even with a stellar comp package. Not impossible, but
unlikely.

### Team / Peers

The team I work with is more important than the company we work for. I enjoy working with teams that have the following attributes.

* **Heterogeneous** --- In skills, background, and experiences.
* **Nimble** --- This typically implies a small team, but a cohesive team can move quickly too.
* **Autonomy** --- Team has agency, and the ability to execute on it.
* **Mentorship** --- Everyone can learn something from someone.

### Day to Day

Day in and day out, this is what I want.

* **Functional languages** --- Pure functions and compostability
* **Ownership** --- Able to use own development environment.
   I live life in a terminal emulator, 80 characters wide.
   Plain text is my preferred interface to the outside world.
   I prefer CLIs, TUIs, and APIs over desktop apps and webUIs.
* **Write meaningful code** --- more mainline code, less glue, minimal (to|ya)ml
* **Agile** --- not Agile^(TM)
* **Iteration** --- Not much is better than an almost instant feedback loop

### Culture

I value the following in the culture where I work.

* **Collaboration** — People work together to solve problems.
  People share knowledge openly and collaborate with people from other roles (e.g. engineering, QA, design, UX, support).
* **Respect** — People respect the people they work with regardless of their role.
  Peers can be honest with each other.

### Perks

* 4+ weeks of vacation.
  This is most important to me, everything else is just icing.


### Pros

The following are above and beyond and will excite me even more about your organization.

* Flexible work schedule.
  4/8/32, 4/10/40, 9/8/80, etc.
* Donation Matching.
* Support for employees using company time for enrichment like professional development, open source contributions, 20% time, community outreach.
* Support for employees attending conferences.
* Support for the local tech community.

### Cons

The following things will make me less excited about your organization.
They're not dealbreakers, but I will probably ask for greater compensation if some of these practices are present at your company.

* An unlimited vacation policy.
* Policies that limit what employees can do with their free time (e.g. banning employees from contributing to open source).
* An excessively corporate structure --- bureaucracy for bureaucracies sake.

### Dealbreaker

Having a *primary* role supporting either a printer, a phone, or a 'legacy' system.
Life is too short.
