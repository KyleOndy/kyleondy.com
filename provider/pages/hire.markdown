<aside>
I am not actively engaged in a job search, I recently "won the job lottery" and
joined Sana Biotechnology.  I'm a technical leader on the team that builds the
research platform, helping build cell and gene therapies that will meaningfully
change the outcome of many human diseases.  [Their aspirations][sana-story] are
compelling and [their core values][sana-values] really resonate with me.
