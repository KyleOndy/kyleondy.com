# em-dash / en-dash / hyphon

These are important distinctions to make since I use [smart punctionation](http://pandoc.org/README.html#smart-punctuation) in pandoc.
Examples taken from [this answer on english.stackexchange.com](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/2116/when-should-i-use-an-em-dash-an-en-dash-and-a-hyphen).

## em-dash

In pandoc use triple dashes, `---`.

An **em-dash** is typically used as a stand-in for a comma or parenthesis to separate out phrases---or even just a word---in a sentence for various reasons (i.e. an appositive). Examples where an em-dash should be used:

* School is based on the three R’s---reading, writing, and ’rithmetic.
* Against all odds, Pete---the unluckiest man alive---won the lottery.
* I sense something; a presence I've not felt since---

## en-dash

in pandoc use double dashes, `--`.

An **en-dash** is used to connect values in a range or that are related. A good rule is to use it when you're expressing a "to" relationship. Examples where an en-dash should be used:

* in years 1939--1945
* pages 31--32 may be relevant
* New York beat Los Angeles 98--95

## hyphen

In pandoc use a single dash, `-`.

A **hyphen** is used to join words in a compound construction, or separate syllables of a word, like during a line break, or (self-evidently) a hyphenated name.

* pro-American
* cruelty-free eggs
* em-dash
* it's pronounced hos-pi-tal-it-tee
* Olivia Newton-John
