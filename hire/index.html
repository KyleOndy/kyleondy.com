  <aside>
While I am not actively engaged in a job search, I will always take the time to
consider interesting and unique opportunities. To ensure I see your message,
follow the directions found at the bottom of this page.
</aside>
<p>I am looking for a positive company culture as much, if not more than the need
for a challenging problem domain. I like to solve difficult and unconventional
problems working along with a motivated small team.</p>
<p>The following is a rundown on my ideal role; <em>if I won the job lottery</em>. I
acknowledge this is a unicorn, but this is an accurate description of the type
of role I would like to be in long-term.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I find great satisfaction increasing productivity via automation, both for
saving resources, and for documentation via automation. I have fallen hard for
functional programming am try to apply the concepts and paradigms to everything
I do.</p>
<p>Working with short iteration and feedback cycles is integral to my
productivity. Due to my work style, I make extensive use of testing, scripting,
and automation to allow me to close the feedback loop while solving problems.</p>
<h2 id="where">Where</h2>
<p><strong>100% Remote.</strong>
I would enjoy an occasional visit to a NYC or Philadelphia office location.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-am-looking-for">What I am Looking For</h2>
<h3 id="company">Company</h3>
<p>The company should fall into one of the three following categories.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A clear and obvious net good to society, simply, I should be proud to work there.</li>
<li>Aligns with my personal interests
<ul>
<li>Supporting people in outdoor recreations</li>
<li>The maker movement</li>
<li>Has heavy contributions to opensource</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compensates well enough to make me care a bit less about the prior two
points.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the company is in ad-tech, defense-tech, or crypto-currency, its going to be
a really hard sell, even with a stellar comp package. Not impossible, but
unlikely.</p>
<h3 id="team-peers">Team / Peers</h3>
<p>The team I work with is more important than the company we work for. I enjoy working with teams that have the following attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heterogeneous</strong> — In skills, background, and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Nimble</strong> — This typically implies a small team, but a cohesive team can move quickly too.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong> — Team has agency, and the ability to execute on it.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship</strong> — Everyone can learn something from someone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="day-to-day">Day to Day</h3>
<p>Day in and day out, this is what I want.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional languages</strong> — Pure functions and compostability</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong> — Able to use own development environment.
I live life in a terminal emulator, 80 characters wide.
Plain text is my preferred interface to the outside world.
I prefer CLIs, TUIs, and APIs over desktop apps and webUIs.</li>
<li><strong>Write meaningful code</strong> — more mainline code, less glue, minimal <code>(to|ya)ml</code></li>
<li><strong>Agile</strong> — not Agile^(TM)</li>
<li><strong>Iteration</strong> — Not much is better than an almost instant feedback loop</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>
<p>I value the following in the culture where I work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> — People work together to solve problems.
People share knowledge openly and collaborate with people from other roles (e.g. engineering, QA, design, UX, support).</li>
<li><strong>Respect</strong> — People respect the people they work with regardless of their role.
Peers can be honest with each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="perks">Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li>4+ weeks of vacation.
This is most important to me, everything and anything else is just icing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>The following are above and beyond and will excite me even more about your organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible work schedule.
4/8/32, 4/10/40, 9/8/80, etc.</li>
<li>Donation Matching.</li>
<li>Support for employees using company time for enrichment like professional development, open source contributions, 20% time, community outreach.</li>
<li>Support for employees attending conferences.</li>
<li>Support for the local tech community.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>The following things will make me less excited about your organization.
They’re not dealbreakers, but I will probably ask for greater compensation if some of these practices are present at your company.</p>
<ul>
<li>An unlimited vacation policy.</li>
<li>Policies that limit what employees can do with their free time (e.g. banning employees from contributing to open source).</li>
<li>An excessively corporate structure — bureaucracy for bureaucracies sake.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dealbreaker">Dealbreaker</h3>
<p>Having a <em>primary</em> role supporting either a printer, a phone, or a ‘legacy’ system.
Life is too short.</p>
<h2 id="contact-me">Contact me</h2>
<p>Does all of this sound interesting to you? Awesome! You should <a href="../contact">contact</a> me if you meet the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>You work for the organization you are contacting me about.
Ideally, you are part of or work closely with the technical team.</li>
<li>You read the post and think your organization would be a good fit for me and vice versa.</li>
<li>Your organization is hiring now or in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact me via email at <a href="mailto:kyle@ondy.org">kyle@ondy.org</a> and include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the organization you are contacting me about.</li>
<li>Where the organization is based.</li>

<li>A brief description of why the organization would be a good fit for me and vice versa.</li>
